# NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)
## UDemy - Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller
> Notes and code captured as part of Udemy's NodeJS course.

* Node.JS basically takes Javascript (JS) from the browser and allows one to run JS anywhere else as if it were like any other programming language.
* Node.JS uses V8 which is the name of the Javascript engine built by Google to run JS in browsers.
    * V8 compiles your JS code and compiles it to machine code for execution by your machine.
    * V8 itself is run in C++.
    * Node.JS adds certain features on top of V8, e.g., working with the local filesystem etc., which allow using JS on top of servers without browsers.
* Node.JS is not limited to running things on a server. It is important to realize that Node is a JS runtime.
  * You can use it for more than just server-side code: utility scripts, build tools (e.g., React, Angular relies on Node for building code and assets).
* Most popular usage is Node.JS' role in web development - running the server, listening to requests, executing business logic (handle requests, validate input, connect to DB etc.), responses (return responses, rendered HTML or JSON or files etc.)

Alternatives to Node.JS include Python (Flask, Django), php (Laravel), Ruby (Rails), ASP.NET etc.
