> Notes and code captured as part of Udemy's NodeJS course.

* Node.JS basically takes Javascript (JS) from the browser and allows one to run JS anywhere else as if it were like any other programming language.
* Node.JS uses V8 which is the name of the Javascript engine built by Google to run JS in browsers.
    * V8 compiles your JS code and compiles it to machine code for execution by your machine.
    * V8 itself is run in C++.
    * Node.JS adds certain features on top of V8, e.g., working with the local filesystem etc., which allow using JS on top of servers without browsers.
